CCGS RDP (A Current Smallbasic Project)

NOTE: This is not free RDP, this is to connect to the remote desktops of ccgrammarschool.co.uk if you are a member of the school.
(If you really want free RDP search up RDP Wrapper on github)

This is a current smallbasic project!
Earlier releases found here:

You can compile using MS Smallbasic 1.2 (for dot net 4.5)/ MS Smallbasic 1.0 (for dot net 3.5)
You also need the litdev extension.
You need to compile the two extensions provided for the correct .net framework and place them in the lib folder which is located or created in the small basic installation folder.
These can be compiled in MS visual studio 2013.

NOTICE: The .net 3.5 can no longer update from any site requiring TLS > 1.2, which breaks updating from github!
THIS MEANS that this version must by manually updated from the update branch and extracting the ccgsrdpdl zip file into the folder containing the rdpccgs binary.

Under GPL V3

And on the note of using the trademark, I'm no longer at the school and not directly affiliated with it.
However, this connection system is designed to facilitate easy connection launching to the school's RDP servers therefore this may be a valid case of use as it is only for this school.
This was made while I was at this school.
